0.22  2018-03-02 10:02:08 EST
  - Hotfix a bug with the minimum git test so it uses a known version (the
    minimum we support) instead of the version the machine happens to have

0.21  2018-03-02 00:37:55 EST
  - Having two distributions list the same module in provides is no longer

  - Fix --skip-lib and --skip-local so they now actually turn a feature off

0.20  2017-07-21 22:28:41 EDT

  - Don't stop processing modules after the first error

    it didn't need to be installed again

  - Goofed up and did 'keys $req', which is not really okay

0.17  2017-04-10 01:18:00 EDT
  - Make --verbose and --quiet work
  - Fix it so module load order doesn't prevent arguments
  - Make sure module versions are revisited after seeing them
  - Calculate the module name since it's not easily gotten

  - Include PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC environment variable to handle the upcoming
    perl v5.26 change that will remove . from the default @INC. Fixes GitHub #3
